You have found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Awesome! And now you want to keep as much as possible of your findings. Just start collecting the nice coins from the pot. 

But someone isn't happy about you keeping all of the gold for yourself. Evil, evil animals are drawing closer. You have to fight them off, but because of your concentration on the gold, all you brought with you was a simple prism. So how can you fight these vicious beasts?

Drawing off your skills earned in introductory physics classes, you channel the rainbow into a laser. With the makeshift weapon, kill off the wild animals while collecting gold. Use the gold to buy upgrades to the weapon, and kill yet more animals. Earn even more gold. Kill all the animals, et cetera.
